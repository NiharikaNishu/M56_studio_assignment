The test cases for the given problem statement are : 

1) Tournament_run array is empty.
   (In this case David will always rank 1)
   SAMPLE INPUT : 0 4
                  5 25 50 120
            
   SAMPLE OUTPUT: 1 1 1 1 

2) David array is empty.
   (In this case there will be no output)
   SAMPLE INPUT : 4 0
                  5 25 50 120
            
   SAMPLE OUTPUT:  
   
3) Tournament_run array may be identical values.
   (It has been handled by taking a temp vector which stores unique values.)
   
   SAMPLE INPUT : 7 4
                  100 100 50 40 40 20 10
                  5 25 50 120
            
   SAMPLE OUTPUT: 6 4 2 1
